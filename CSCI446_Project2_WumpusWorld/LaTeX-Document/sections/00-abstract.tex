Logical inference is used to determine state based off of rules rather than direct perception.
This paper explores the benefits of first order logical inference through the domain of the Wumpus World: an agent is told to explore a two dimensional world of rooms with dangers such as pits and monsters with a goal state of finding the single room containing gold.
The agent utilizes an inference engine that is fed perceptions about the world from the agent while providing actions for the agent to take. 
The actions are based off of what the inference engine can decipher about rooms without having actually visited the room.

This paper explores the process of first order axiomatic sentences, unification, and resolution through proof by contradiction. 
A secondary agent that does not have any logical reasoning ability is also introduced that is used to compare the effectiveness of of logic-based agent.
The logic-based agent dramatically outperforms the secondary agent in every metric except for the total number of decisions that are made through a dungeon exploration.
