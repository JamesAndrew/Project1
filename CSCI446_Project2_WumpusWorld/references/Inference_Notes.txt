- Lots of changes to the UML. Be sure to update after the fact
- KnowledgeBase.resolution_subroutine() is very unoptimized at the moment. Talk about better ways 
  to pairwise compare and not generate already generated resolvents (this is fixed)
- Axioms must already be in CNF form (maybe don't need to talk about this)
- Asserted existence of every cell upon KB creation to work with edge cases such as with seeing is there is a wumpus or pit
- Code would be heavily optimized if there was a way to only use the axioms relevant to what is being queried
	- put good work in to this, be sure to talk about it
